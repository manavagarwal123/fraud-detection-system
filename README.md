# fraud-detection-system
This project, titled “Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions,” was developed as part of my internship with Zaalima Development. The primary objective was to analyze and classify financial transactions to detect fraudulent activity using machine learning. I began by loading and exploring the dataset, identifying the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. I then performed data cleaning and feature engineering to improve the quality of the input data. To address the severe class imbalance, I used the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and trained a classification model using XGBoost, one of the most effective algorithms for this task. The model was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving strong results on the imbalanced data. To make the solution interactive and user-friendly, I also developed a Streamlit dashboard that allows real-time fraud prediction based on input features. Throughout this project, I strengthened my skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and model deployment. This experience not only deepened my understanding of machine learning for real-world problems but also enhanced my ability to build practical, deployable data science applications. I would like to thank my mentors and the entire Zaalima team for their guidance and support during this journey.
